# Remote Communcations Server
This small site is meant to act as a communications server between Roblox and Discord.
As POST requests cannot be directly forwarded to Roblox's servers, a median server is required in which Discord writes from POST requests to the server, and Roblox reads from GET requests to the server.

This pairs well with the other project that I've made, [remote-comms-bot](https://github.com/EpicFazbear/remote-comms-bot), which is a bot that sends Discord users' messages to the communications server.

Made by EpicFazbear :P

(I may add more detail in the future, message me on GitHub or Roblox if you need anything)
