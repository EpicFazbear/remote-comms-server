# Remote Admin Testing
This is a branched off version of heavy dictator where I try and make a functional remote admin API .-.

Made by EpicFazbear :p

-- Todo List --
- Set the refresh rate
- Stop for X seconds
- Whitelist/blacklist certain users from using the bot
- Enable/disable the webhook
- Make commands that are run on discord visible in chat (unless they are /e, in which case the discord bot deletes the message right after)

- Also, add it so that the bot doesn't count webhooks
- Also consider if multiple people speak in the same timeframe
